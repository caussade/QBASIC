This GitHub website is intended to be the official home for computer software that I have authored, both as source code and pre-compiled binaries.  All software is original work developed and copyrighted by me.

With the single exception of software that I may occasionally offer via my personal website, I should warn that packages bearing my name from elsewhere in the Internet may not be necessarily up-to-date or even compromised on their intergity.

All my software is licensed via GPL v2, which means that everything is freely available for both commercial and personal use, but comes without any warranty.  See the "license.txt" file for more information.
